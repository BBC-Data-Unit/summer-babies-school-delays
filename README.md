In October 2018 the BBC reported that [parents who want to delay their child's first year of school have varying success rates depending on where they live](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45901714).

Figures supplied under the Freedom of Information Act show 2,243 requests were made to 110 local authorities in England to defer starts to the 2018 school year - 18% higher than the previous 12 months.

But the rate of requests and their success rates varied considerably across England.
